AI-Powered Proposal Generator project (with MongoDB, FastAPI, React, Gemini).

📝 Main Functionalities
1. Authentication & Authorization

✅ Register & Login (with JWT tokens)

✅ Password hashing (bcrypt via passlib)

✅ Roles:

Analyst → can create proposals, use templates

Manager → can view all proposals, manage templates

2. Template Management (Markdown-based)

✅ CRUD for templates (create, read, update, delete)

✅ Templates contain placeholders like {{clientName}}, {{services}}, etc.

✅ Stored in MongoDB with title, content, created_by

✅ Analysts manage their own templates, managers can view all

3. Proposal Generation (AI-powered)

✅ Form-based input: clientName, industry, services[], objectives, scope, timeline, budget, tone, templateId?

✅ Merge inputs into selected template using md_utils

✅ Call Google Gemini API to refine and enhance into professional Markdown proposal

✅ Save generated proposal (Markdown + metadata) into MongoDB

4. Proposals Management

✅ Save generated proposals per user

✅ List proposals (analyst sees own, manager sees all)

✅ View single proposal by ID

✅ Stored as: id, owner_id, template_id?, payload_json, markdown, created_at

5. Export Functionality (Frontend)

✅ Export to PDF (using html2canvas + jspdf)

✅ Export to DOCX (using docx npm library)

✅ Runs in browser (no backend dependency for export)

6. User Interface (React + Tailwind)

✅ Login page (email + password, stores JWT in localStorage)

✅ Home page with two-pane layout:

Left → Proposal Form + Template Picker

Right → Live Markdown Preview + Export Buttons

✅ Topbar: app name, role badge, login/logout

✅ Responsive design (works on desktop & mobile)

7. Supporting Features
